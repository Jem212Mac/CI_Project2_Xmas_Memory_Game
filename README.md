## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

As a user, I want to play a game that will test my memory in a fun and interactive way.

As a user, I want to play a game that delights me with a xmas theme, particularly in the run up to xmas, using xmas imagery and colours.

As a user, I want the game to be intuitive to play, meaning that instructions are not necessary, but can be accessed if needed.

As a user, i want the game to provide me with instant feedback by recording the number of moves I have made, and using sound effects to let me know when cards have been flipped.

As a user, I want the game to let me know when I have won using a pop up modal and sound effects.

As a user, I want to be able to restart the game at any point by clicking a button.

As a user, I want to be able to change the background image, at any point in the game, to suit my mood.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme includes traditional xmas colours including red, white, silver and gold.

### Typography

The christmas banner used in the header incorporates a scripted style of font which fits in well with the christmas theme.  All other text makes use of a google font (Open Sans) which is a sans-serif font that is clear and easy to read.  This is important for modal's which provide information to the user and for buttons that may need to be clicked by the user.

### Imagery

Xmas imagery is used throughout the site, with a choice of three background images consisting of a 3D wintery scene, a decorated blue xmas tree background, and a blue background with xmas baubles, sparkles and snow.  Xmas themed images are used on the memory cards, including several images of snowmen and santa claus, a reindeer, a gingerbread man, a polar bear and a penguin.

### Wireframes

Software was not used to create a wireframe, but a wireframe design was drawn out before any coding was started, as shown below.  The wireframe design was changed a little as the project progressed, to allow for the inclusion of the christmas banner in the header, and more cards in the card area, but the structure remained basically the same.
