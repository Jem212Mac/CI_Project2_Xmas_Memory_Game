# Xmas Memory Game

This is a xmas themed memory game created using html, css and javascript to demonstrate my coding skills for my PP2 project with Code Institute.  The purpose of the game is to test the player's memory and also to appeal to anyone who wants to get into the xmas spirit via the use of a xmas colour pallette and xmas themed images on the memory cards.
